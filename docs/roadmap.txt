Roadmap
=======

Setuptools has the following large-scale goals on the roadmap:

- Mature declarative config to supersede imperative config in
  all supported use-cases and harmonize with pyproject.toml
  syntax.
- Deprecate and remove setup_requires and easy_install in
  favor of PEP 518 build requirements and pip install.
- Adopt the Distutils package and stop monkeypatching stdlib.
