Welcome to Distribute's documentation!
======================================

`Distribute` is a deprecated fork of the `Setuptools` project.

Since the Setuptools 0.7 release, Setuptools and Distribute have merged
and Distribute is no longer being maintained. This documentation is kept here
for posterity, but all ongoing effort should reference the
`Setuptools project <https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools>`_ and the
`Setuptools documentation <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools>`_.
